## Fallback System

The JavaScript code has a fallback system:
1. Try seasonal variant first (e.g., `clearsky_summer.png`)
2. Try exact match (e.g., `clearsky_day.jpg`)
3. Try base code (e.g., `clearsky.jpg`)
4. Use gradient background if neither exists

This means you can create either:
- **Seasonal images** for maximum variety (e.g., `rain_summer.png`, `rain_autumn.png`)
- **Base images** only (less work, still looks great)
- **Mix of both** (seasonal for common conditions, generic for rare ones)

---

## üçÇ SEASONAL VARIANTS (Optional but Recommended!)

Norwegian seasons are very distinct. Adding seasonal variants makes the display much more dynamic and accurate to what's actually happening outside.

### Season Detection
The system automatically detects the current season:
- **Spring**: March, April, May
- **Summer**: June, July, August
- **Autumn**: September, October, November
- **Winter**: December, January, February

### Naming Convention for Seasonal Images
Add `_spring`, `_summer`, `_autumn`, or `_winter` to the base filename:
- `clearsky_spring.png`
- `rain_summer.png`
- `cloudy_autumn.png`
- `fog_winter.png`

## Seasonal Generation Strategy

**Start with these seasonal variants** (most noticeable differences):
1. **clearsky_summer.png** & **clearsky_winter.png** - Dramatic difference
2. **rain_summer.png** & **rain_autumn.png** - Very common, very different look
3. **cloudy_autumn.png** - Beautiful golden colors
4. **fog_autumn.png** - Mystical autumn fog
5. **partlycloudy_summer.png** - Perfect summer day

**Optional but great additions:**
- All four seasons for: clearsky, rain, cloudy, fog
- Summer/autumn variants for: partlycloudy, fair, rainshowers

**Can skip seasonal variants** (less visible difference or rare):
- thunder, sleet, heavyrain, snow (already season-specific)
- thundersnow, polartwiight (winter only)

---

**Total images needed**:
- **Minimum**: 12-15 base images (no seasons)
- **Recommended**: 20-30 images (key seasonal variants)
- **Maximum**: 60+ images (all seasons for all conditions)
