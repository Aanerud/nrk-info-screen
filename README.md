## Quick Start

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Configure** your location in `config.js`
3. **(Optional)** Add your `logo.png` file (max 150x80px recommended)
4. **Open** `index.html` in a modern web browser
5. **Click** the fullscreen button (bottom-right corner)

## Configuration

Edit `config.js` to customize your display:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    // Your location (for weather)
    city: "Oslo",
    country: "Norway",
    latitude: 59.9139,
    longitude: 10.7522,

    // News RSS feed (NRK feeds recommended)
    newsRssFeed: 'https://www.nrk.no/nyheter/siste.rss',

    // Timing (in milliseconds)
    weatherUpdateInterval: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 60 minutes
    newsUpdateInterval: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    newsRotationInterval: 15 * 1000 // 15 seconds
};
```

### Finding Your Coordinates

- Use [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) - right-click any location and select the coordinates
- Or use [LatLong.net](https://www.latlong.net/)

### Finding NRK RSS Feeds

Visit [NRK's RSS page](https://www.nrk.no/toppsaker.rss) to find various regional and national feeds:

- **National News**: `https://www.nrk.no/nyheter/siste.rss`
- **Regional Feeds**: Available for all regions (Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, etc.)
- **Topic-specific**: Sports, culture, weather, and more

**Note**: This app is optimized for NRK RSS feeds. Other feeds may work but are not guaranteed.

## Logo (Optional)

The app works perfectly without a logo. If you want to add branding:

1. Create or prepare your logo image
2. Save it as `logo.png` in the project root
3. **Recommended size**: Maximum 150px wide Ã— 80px tall
4. **Format**: PNG with transparency works best

The logo will appear in the bottom-left corner. If no logo is provided, nothing breaks - the space simply remains empty.
